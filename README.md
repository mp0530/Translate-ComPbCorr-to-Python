# Translate-ComPbCorr-to-Python

Not able to run successfully yet!

Abstract:
This project is to translate the legacy VBA code in the ComPbCorr software (Andersen, 2002) to Python. 

ComPbCorr is a software designed to handle lead loss and common lead issue that contribute errors to the accuracy of the U-Pb dating method. This impactful algorithm has received 4198 citations according to Google Scholar. The original VBA code utilized an old version of VBA that requires a 32-bit version of Excel to compile and a 32-bit system to execute. As we know, Dr. Andersen is no longer maintaining the code, and it became unnecessary for scientists to keep an old computer just for manipulating data once a month. Python, as oppose to VBA, is getting more mature, it is both easy and convenient (feasible on different platform), and the language itself won't be changed in the forseeable future. This makes translating the code to a modern language critical, and Python is without a doubt a good choice.
